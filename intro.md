# Project Introduction

## Overview

**Godspeed_new** is an intelligent backend service that streamlines the process of converting GitHub repositories into searchable knowledge. It leverages cutting-edge technologies such as FastAPI, BERT-based embeddings, and Pinecone vector search to provide fast and semantic retrieval of code and documentation.

## Problem It Solves

Modern repositories contain vast amounts of information spread across code files, documentation, configs, and scripts. Manually searching through this content is inefficient. Godspeed_new solves this by:

- Automatically cloning and parsing repositories
- Extracting textual data from various file formats
- Generating vector embeddings using a transformer model
- Enabling semantic search via Pinecone

This makes it ideal for code intelligence, documentation search, and project analysis.

## Tech Stack

- **FastAPI**: Backend API framework
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: BERT model for embedding generation
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for efficient similarity search
- **GitPython**: For cloning GitHub repositories
- **Langchain**: For managing text chunks and metadata (optional)

## Ideal Use Cases

- Developer search engine for large codebases
- Internal documentation search for teams
- Automated project summarization or tagging
- AI assistants for devtools

## Future Improvements

- Frontend UI for search
- GitHub authentication for private repo access
- Ranking search results by relevance
- Support for additional file formats (e.g., PDFs, notebooks)

This project is modular and open to contributions for extending its capabilities and integrating into other tools.
